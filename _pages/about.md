I am a second-year Computer Science graduate student at <a href='https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/'>New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>. I am currently focused on my Master’s Thesis research on Programmable Computer Networks and Compiler Optimisation under <a href='https://anirudhsk.github.io/'>Prof. Anirudh Sivaraman</a>.

My primary research interests are parallelization, program and compiler optimization, and computer networks. I work extensively in the field of programmable network switches, focusing on building highly optimized compilers and transpilation tools for network programs. I am also interested in general language-agnostic task parallelization techniques using thread-level tools.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Goldman Sachs, where I focused on building low-latency Java-based backend microservices that served critical in-house financial software powering the asset management business. I also built a reliability monitoring service to ensure the active working of day-to-day services that financial analysts use. I also interned at Cisco Systems, being identified as the best Summer Intern, where I built a fully automated unit-testing framework integrated with the control plane software of the IOS-XR operating system, reducing the human effort and failure rates of essential software.

Even earlier, I worked as a Summer Research Intern at the Microsoft Innovation Lab during my undergraduate studies at PES University, where I worked on a Customer Feedback Model to analyze the customer review data of a company and help identify critical issues based on their severity, built using NLP and Sentiment Analysis models.

When not working, I love geeking out over Formula 1, Cricket, MMA, and other sports. And not to forget, I make a mean Masala Dose and a filter coffee to go along with it!
